//Js is not a strongly typed language
//Js is a CASE SENSİTİVE language

//3 ways we can define variable

//var,let 
//const if the variable is fixed and can not be changed
//let: you can declare the variable inside the block
//var: you can declare it whereever you want

let message = "Hello to Js";
console.log(message);
message = 'Js is fun';
console.log(message);

var num = 10;//we can also create with let

console.log(num);

let price = 1399.99;

console.log('Iphone price is '+ price);

let hired = true;

console.log('Is Ali hired '+ hired);

let coffee;

console.log(coffee);//undefined

let negativity = null;

console.log(negativity);

//create a variable that can not change
//const => short for constant a calue that doesnt change like final keyword in Apex
//EX: public static final double pi;

const fName = "Chris";

//fName = "smth"; throw an error const variable can not be reassigned
